= Actuator REST API

This API documentation describes Spring Boot Actuators web endpoints.

Before you proceed, you should read the following topics:

* <<urls,URLs>>
* <<timestamps,Timestamps>>

NOTE: In order to get the correct JSON responses documented below, Jackson must be available.

[[urls]]
== URLs

By default, all web endpoints are available beneath the path `/actuator` with URLs of the form `pass:[/actuator/{id}]`.
The `/actuator` base path can be configured by using the `management.endpoints.web.base-path` property, as shown in the following example:

[source]
----
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/manage
----

The preceding `application.properties` example changes the form of the endpoint URLs from `pass:[/actuator/{id}]` to `pass:[/manage/{id}]`.
For example, the URL `info` endpoint would become `/manage/info`.

[[timestamps]]
== Timestamps

All timestamps that are consumed by the endpoints, either as query parameters or in the request body, must be formatted as an offset date and time as specified in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601,window=_blank].
